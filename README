HOW TO BUILD AND RUN THE APP AND START THE CACHE SERVER

To run the application it should start on port 8080
This is a maven project:

1. run mvn clean validate compile (in the root)

2. in the docker directory which is in the root run
   docker compose up (this starts redis)

   /weather/docker

3. To start the app server run 
   mvn spring-boot:run

This will start the server the which is running on port 8080
The react client is hard coded to point to port 8080
